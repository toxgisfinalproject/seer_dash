```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
First, we'll generate a small vector of chemical names:
```{r}
county_cancer_chem = readRDS( "cancer_county_chem_pop.rds") %>% 
  mutate(prevalence = n/pop_est) #need a way to avoid reading this in twice.
county_cancer_chem %>% pull(chemical) %>% saveRDS("chemical_names.rds")
county_cancer_chem %>% pull(cancer) %>% saveRDS("cancer_names.rds")
```
